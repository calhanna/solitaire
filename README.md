# solitaire
A version of Klondike solitaire, based on that found in the gnome-games package. Made in python3 using the library PyGame and assets from the library PythonArcade.

Rules:
  - Clicking on the stock will reveal the first card. Not the first 3 cards, because I think that's dumb.
  - You can undo, but not redo. Redo it yourself.
  - Double clicking on a card will send it to the appropriate foundation
  - Passes through the stock are unlimited

Other than that, this is just normal Klondike
